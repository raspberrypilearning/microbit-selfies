## What you will make

[[[camera-bullseye]]]

In this resource, you will make a micro:bit-controlled selfie booth with a Raspberry Pi and camera module, using Python. This is a great way to get started with hardware and simple text programming. 

## What you will learn
By creating a micro:bit-triggered selfie booth with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to set up a Raspberry Pi camera
- How to use input and output pins on the micro:bit and Raspberry Pi
- Controlling GPIO pins with Python code
- Controlling the camera module with Python code

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
